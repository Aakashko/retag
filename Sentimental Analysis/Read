Phase 1:
In the first approach, a sequential model is used. A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor 
and one output tensor.

Datasets Used for this:
The IMDB large movie review dataset is a binary classification datasetâ€”all the reviews have either a positive or negative sentiment.

Result:
The result shown us that our model has to improve irrespective of giving us an accuracy of 80%. Also the reviews are in terms of either negative or positive.
The neutral and all other intermediate reviews were not classified with this model. A better model has to substituted for this which states all the required emotion expressed by the user.
